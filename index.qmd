Welcome to my website! My name is Josh Allen and I earned my PhD in the Department of Political Science at Georgia State University. I earned my M.A. at Georgia State and am a proud Sonoma State University alum.

My research focuses on the impact of the Holocaust on contemporary political attitudes in Europe using causal inference tools and Large Language Models.
