    "text": "At GSU, we have Early Alert that is meant to connect students with resources if they are not doing well in the first few weeks of classes. While setting up your rules of thumb is up to you, this can quickly soak up an entire day if you are going row by row in your class of 60 or more students. To streamline the process I turned to R because it is a fairly simple data cleaning task.\nOur learning management software likes to add lots of extra stuff to the column names in our data. While most of us would come up with a more concise name like Chapter_4 our software exports the column names as assignment name, grading scheme, and the weights that are assigned. So it looks like Chapter 4.2 Points Grade &lt;Numeric MaxPoints:100 Weight:3.125 Category:Area9 Chapters CategoryWeight:23&gt;. We could use janitor::clean_names to eliminate some of the extraneous stuff, however iCollege will get grumpy at us because they do not match the names in the gradebook. We could do this in Excel, and I have done it in the past, I figured I could speed this up in R while avoiding the headaches of ensuring each and every column is where it should be.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nset.seed(1994)\n\nstudents = 26\n\ndat = tibble(id = 1:26,\n             Students = LETTERS,\n             `Chapter 4.2 Points Grade &lt;Numeric MaxPoints:100 Weight:3.125 Category:Area9 Chapters CategoryWeight:23&gt;` = rnorm(students, mean = 90, sd = 5),\n            `Chapter 4.3 Points Grade &lt;Numeric MaxPoints:100 Weight:3.125 Category:Area9 Chapters CategoryWeight:23&gt;` = rnorm(students, mean = 90, sd = 5),\n            `Chapter 4.4  Points Grade &lt;Numeric MaxPoints:100 Weight:3.125 Category:Area9 Chapters CategoryWeight:23&gt;` = rnorm(students, mean = 90, sd = 5),\n            `Chapter 4.5  Points Grade &lt;Numeric MaxPoints:100 Weight:3.125 Category:Area9 Chapters CategoryWeight:23&gt;` = rnorm(students, mean = 90, sd = 5),\n            `Exam 1 Points Grade &lt;Numeric MaxPoints:55 Weight 10 Category: Exams` = rnorm(students, mean = 85, sd = 3))  \n\nIn this simple example there are only 5 columns they have annoying names sure but it is not that bad. We can probably copy and paste them and we will be fine. However, in my real data there are 13 or so chapters with a few subsections in each of them. So this can get out from under us kind of quick and copy and pasting does not make our lives any easier. We also usually get columns that do not help us. Our ID variable is not doing anything other than providing the same info in a less transparent way than the student name variable, and more minor items like surveys which do not have a lot of weight on their final grade.\nI just used rnorm for convenience; however your data is more likely to have some missing values because students did not do stuff so it looks like this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\nStudents\nChapter 4.2 Points Grade &lt;Numeric MaxPoints:100 Weight:3.125 Category:Area9 Chapters CategoryWeight:23&gt;\nChapter 4.3 Points Grade &lt;Numeric MaxPoints:100 Weight:3.125 Category:Area9 Chapters CategoryWeight:23&gt;\nChapter 4.4 Points Grade &lt;Numeric MaxPoints:100 Weight:3.125 Category:Area9 Chapters CategoryWeight:23&gt;\nChapter 4.5 Points Grade &lt;Numeric MaxPoints:100 Weight:3.125 Category:Area9 Chapters CategoryWeight:23&gt;\nExam 1 Points Grade &lt;Numeric MaxPoints:55 Weight 10 Category: Exams\nsurveys\n\n\n\n\n1\nA\n83.56343\n81.70468\n85.71587\n85.97115\n83.71489\n100\n\n\n2\nB\n91.44406\n86.12473\n91.53892\n91.80590\n84.62108\n100\n\n\n3\nC\n98.50185\n89.76872\n91.79794\nNA\n85.11662\n100\n\n\n4\nD\n96.99304\n88.53903\n83.42538\n92.42625\n86.08429\n100\n\n\n5\nE\n90.49552\n92.64055\n93.27846\n89.24096\n80.39882\n100\n\n\n6\nF\n83.30126\n86.91250\n90.75522\n83.04509\n78.98100\n100\n\n\n7\nG\n94.03755\n81.34807\n87.57366\n99.04721\n80.11158\n100\n\n\n8\nH\n89.47185\n89.62792\n91.37094\n96.30433\n89.58399\n100\n\n\n9\nI\n92.78107\nNA\n96.44479\n87.20809\n81.31118\n100\n\n\n10\nJ\n83.04019\n88.74052\nNA\n96.58848\n85.93511\n100\n\n\n11\nK\n91.57146\nNA\n87.94661\n93.73501\n88.43763\n100\n\n\n12\nL\n94.18791\n89.64253\n90.53395\n88.29499\n86.82630\n100\n\n\n13\nM\n95.96341\n94.94366\n91.53490\n85.17583\n82.57437\n100\n\n\n14\nN\n84.91042\n90.50202\n93.41616\n87.64364\n83.46703\n100\n\n\n15\nO\n92.76743\n81.32158\n84.05944\n103.32883\n87.00560\n100\n\n\n16\nP\n92.48953\n93.73259\n91.46155\n93.64285\n87.11260\n100\n\n\n17\nQ\n91.88890\n91.99284\n95.01500\n95.61172\n84.63614\n100\n\n\n18\nR\n87.25405\n89.89440\n91.07664\n91.93496\n89.64706\n100\n\n\n19\nS\n83.62513\n82.48662\nNA\n92.74020\n90.45662\n100\n\n\n20\nT\n87.91310\n92.87887\n95.78937\n84.74539\n86.05332\n100\n\n\n21\nU\n91.36955\n96.67913\n90.59384\n87.86449\n79.76733\n100\n\n\n22\nV\n91.30800\n87.35611\n88.29575\n90.40188\n89.97015\n100\n\n\n23\nW\nNA\n89.35205\n97.02888\nNA\n82.47724\n100\n\n\n24\nX\n94.06035\n83.28452\n97.71377\n82.26974\n90.26051\n100\n\n\n25\nY\nNA\n91.24920\n96.15636\n88.80131\n90.26133\n100\n\n\n26\nZ\n94.57923\n93.57157\n91.66163\n91.83234\n84.33456\n100\n\n\n\n\n\nSo for the purpose of the report I treat NA’s as zeros. If you are dealing with multiple columns this is a pretty easy step just use mutate(across) and using some combination of starts_with, contains, everything, or ends_with to achieve the desired goal.\n\nimputed =  dat_miss %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(c(starts_with(\"exam\"), starts_with(\"chapter\"), \n                  ), ~replace(., is.na(.), 0)))\n\nSo that should take care of the NA's but we still need to generate our indicators. The assignments that carry the most weight are exams and the chapters, so I focus the most on those. In my use case, taking the sum makes sense, but for yours the average is probably the better option. Thankfully, while the learning management software names are a bit cumbersome, they do share something in common. So we can use mutate(across) and rowwise to make our life easier. rowwise is a pretty neat little function that works perfectly for this task where you are trying to do things for each student. Then you can use case_when or ifelse to generate a logical to create your flag. This is a toy example, but we can quickly start to build it out for our specific use cases. Using a mixture of apply and select you can achieve the same thing.\n\n flag = imputed %&gt;% \n  rowwise() %&gt;% \n  mutate(flag_dplyr = round(sum(across(starts_with(\"chapter\")))))\n\n\nflag$flag_apply = imputed %&gt;% \n  select(contains(\"chapter\")) %&gt;% \n  apply(., 1, function(row){\n    round(sum(row))\n  })\n\nCool, we can use this for our basic stuff, but I tend to weigh exams by how well students did. So your highest exam score counts for more, and your lowest exam has the least amount of weight. As with lots of things in R you can do this a few ways. There is probably a more concise way of doing this with apply it is ugly but works.\n\nexams_complete = imputed %&gt;% \n  mutate(`Exam 2 Points Grade &lt;Numeric MaxPoints:55 Weight 10 Category: Exams` = rnorm(students, mean = 70, sd = 11),\n         `Exam 3 Points Grade &lt;Numeric MaxPoints:55 Weight 10 Category: Exams` = rnorm(students, mean = 75, sd = 11))\n\n\n\nexams_complete$higest_exam_apply = exams_complete %&gt;%  \n  select(contains(\"Exam\")) %&gt;% \n  apply(., 1, function(row){\n    round(max(row))\n  })\n\n\nexams_complete = exams_complete %&gt;% \n  rowwise() %&gt;% \n  mutate(hig_exam_dplyr = round(max(c_across(contains(\"Exam\")))))\n\nexams_complete$lowest_exam_apply = exams_complete %&gt;%  \n  select(contains(\"Exam\")) %&gt;% \n  apply(., 1, function(row){\n    round(min(row))\n  })\n\nexams_complete = exams_complete %&gt;% \n  rowwise() %&gt;% \n  mutate(low_exam_dplyr = round(min(c_across(contains(\"Exam\")))))\n\nSo this is easy enough because we are just changing what we are doing with our summary function, but what about the second highest exam score? In this case you are going to have to use some trickery to get what you want\n\nexams_complete$second_highest = exams_complete %&gt;% \n  select(starts_with(\"Exam\")) %&gt;% \n  apply(., 1, function(row){\n    round(sort(row, decreasing = TRUE)[2])\n  })\n\nThis is simple enough and you can just use select and filter to get the info you want. However, as we all know we have to do some grading. You can use all your favorite dplyr tricks to grade and impute grades. This is the easy part, and now you can start to expand this out to using R to automate calculating grades. One super neat assignment all Intro to Government students at Georgia State do is assigning an adult field trip of sorts that is free for them. The students go to the National Center for Civil and Human Rights and do a tour and simulation of the lunch counter sit-ins. There are a few components to this: they submit a unique code as part of the proof that they have done it. Naturally, as is the case, some students just did not do it, but that nbd just use our friend left join, but to retain all the students be sure to include keep = TRUE so each student gets graded.\n\ncodes_data = tibble(id = 1:10,\n             Students = LETTERS[1:10],\n             code = 100)\n\n\nexams_complete = mutate(exams_complete, Code = NA)\n\n\ngrades_with_codes = left_join(exams_complete, codes_data, by = \"Students\", keep = TRUE) %&gt;% \n  mutate(Code = code,\n         Code = ifelse(is.na(Code), 0, Code)) %&gt;% \n  rename(id = id.x,\n         students = Students.x) %&gt;% \n  select(-id.y, -Students.y, -code)\n\nIn the real data, I join by using last names, which works for the most part. But you may need to check to make sure that your LMS has correctly spelled your students’ last name or, just as importantly, they spelled their last name correctly. Hopefully, this helps somebody. If not, at least it is tucked in a nice blog post. Be sure to check everything to make sure it is working, but if it works correctly then hopefully , you get a nice graded dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\nstudents\nChapter 4.2 Points Grade &lt;Numeric MaxPoints:100 Weight:3.125 Category:Area9 Chapters CategoryWeight:23&gt;\nChapter 4.3 Points Grade &lt;Numeric MaxPoints:100 Weight:3.125 Category:Area9 Chapters CategoryWeight:23&gt;\nChapter 4.4 Points Grade &lt;Numeric MaxPoints:100 Weight:3.125 Category:Area9 Chapters CategoryWeight:23&gt;\nChapter 4.5 Points Grade &lt;Numeric MaxPoints:100 Weight:3.125 Category:Area9 Chapters CategoryWeight:23&gt;\nExam 1 Points Grade &lt;Numeric MaxPoints:55 Weight 10 Category: Exams\nsurveys\nExam 2 Points Grade &lt;Numeric MaxPoints:55 Weight 10 Category: Exams\nExam 3 Points Grade &lt;Numeric MaxPoints:55 Weight 10 Category: Exams\nhigest_exam_apply\nhig_exam_dplyr\nlowest_exam_apply\nlow_exam_dplyr\nsecond_highest\nCode\n\n\n\n\n1\nA\n83.56343\n81.70468\n85.71587\n85.97115\n83.71489\n100\n58.06166\n68.83867\n84\n84\n58\n58\n69\n100\n\n\n2\nB\n91.44406\n86.12473\n91.53892\n91.80590\n84.62108\n100\n69.96645\n73.51084\n85\n85\n70\n70\n74\n100\n\n\n3\nC\n98.50185\n89.76872\n91.79794\n0.00000\n85.11662\n100\n66.30306\n74.42536\n85\n85\n66\n66\n74\n100\n\n\n4\nD\n96.99304\n88.53903\n83.42538\n92.42625\n86.08429\n100\n65.79288\n85.94456\n86\n86\n66\n66\n86\n100\n\n\n5\nE\n90.49552\n92.64055\n93.27846\n89.24096\n80.39882\n100\n88.72094\n64.87935\n89\n89\n65\n65\n80\n100\n\n\n6\nF\n83.30126\n86.91250\n90.75522\n83.04509\n78.98100\n100\n80.41976\n73.06732\n80\n80\n73\n73\n79\n100\n\n\n7\nG\n94.03755\n81.34807\n87.57366\n99.04721\n80.11158\n100\n86.56743\n66.79291\n87\n87\n67\n67\n80\n100\n\n\n8\nH\n89.47185\n89.62792\n91.37094\n96.30433\n89.58399\n100\n87.48637\n74.13581\n90\n90\n74\n74\n87\n100\n\n\n9\nI\n92.78107\n0.00000\n96.44479\n87.20809\n81.31118\n100\n69.63665\n68.36826\n81\n81\n68\n68\n70\n100\n\n\n10\nJ\n83.04019\n88.74052\n0.00000\n96.58848\n85.93511\n100\n69.71254\n71.65925\n86\n86\n70\n70\n72\n100\n\n\n11\nK\n91.57146\n0.00000\n87.94661\n93.73501\n88.43763\n100\n71.99278\n78.33438\n88\n88\n72\n72\n78\n0\n\n\n12\nL\n94.18791\n89.64253\n90.53395\n88.29499\n86.82630\n100\n66.30946\n99.16532\n99\n99\n66\n66\n87\n0\n\n\n13\nM\n95.96341\n94.94366\n91.53490\n85.17583\n82.57437\n100\n71.14509\n62.94670\n83\n83\n63\n63\n71\n0\n\n\n14\nN\n84.91042\n90.50202\n93.41616\n87.64364\n83.46703\n100\n66.72115\n67.17081\n83\n83\n67\n67\n67\n0\n\n\n15\nO\n92.76743\n81.32158\n84.05944\n103.32883\n87.00560\n100\n88.98898\n66.12589\n89\n89\n66\n66\n87\n0\n\n\n16\nP\n92.48953\n93.73259\n91.46155\n93.64285\n87.11260\n100\n63.42139\n77.70564\n87\n87\n63\n63\n78\n0\n\n\n17\nQ\n91.88890\n91.99284\n95.01500\n95.61172\n84.63614\n100\n70.82987\n53.49421\n85\n85\n53\n53\n71\n0\n\n\n18\nR\n87.25405\n89.89440\n91.07664\n91.93496\n89.64706\n100\n69.95649\n86.20525\n90\n90\n70\n70\n86\n0\n\n\n19\nS\n83.62513\n82.48662\n0.00000\n92.74020\n90.45662\n100\n78.62938\n64.34364\n90\n90\n64\n64\n79\n0\n\n\n20\nT\n87.91310\n92.87887\n95.78937\n84.74539\n86.05332\n100\n84.55215\n80.42847\n86\n86\n80\n80\n85\n0\n\n\n21\nU\n91.36955\n96.67913\n90.59384\n87.86449\n79.76733\n100\n75.08180\n64.40788\n80\n80\n64\n64\n75\n0\n\n\n22\nV\n91.30800\n87.35611\n88.29575\n90.40188\n89.97015\n100\n68.53960\n79.79600\n90\n90\n69\n69\n80\n0\n\n\n23\nW\n0.00000\n89.35205\n97.02888\n0.00000\n82.47724\n100\n88.95738\n70.28810\n89\n89\n70\n70\n82\n0\n\n\n24\nX\n94.06035\n83.28452\n97.71377\n82.26974\n90.26051\n100\n63.12942\n78.58372\n90\n90\n63\n63\n79\n0\n\n\n25\nY\n0.00000\n91.24920\n96.15636\n88.80131\n90.26133\n100\n88.82365\n86.03999\n90\n90\n86\n86\n89\n0\n\n\n26\nZ\n94.57923\n93.57157\n91.66163\n91.83234\n84.33456\n100\n65.54887\n82.58063\n84\n84\n66\n66\n83\n0"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Hi all, when I first stated using R I tried making my website using blogdown. While Alison Hill PhD provides an excellent intro to launching your website. However, I am truly special and managed to mess this process up. For a few days whenever I did anything more computationally intensive than\n\nrm(list=ls())\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nI would get a nasty error message saying “c stack usage is too close to the limit” and I could not do anything. This would have been fine but at the time I was still taking classes and need to have R working to complete the problem sets.\nSo what did I do to get in the c stack death spiral and how did it end up being fixed? For the former you should not skip steps in Dr. Hill’s post. For the later well to spare you the long arduous process here is what we tried.\n\nme consulting stackoverflow & realizing I really f****k up\nrestarting my computer\nuninstalling & reinstalling blogdown\nuninstalling & reinstalling R\nuninstalling & reinstalling pandocs\n\nAfter hours of trouble shooting #rstats twitter came to the rescue when this distress signal was sent out.\n\n\n#rstats world! I have a student who is getting a \"c stack usage is too close to the limit\" every time when using knitr (even with an R-chunk-free Rmd file) & getting same error when trying to install anything with devtools or remotes. We've un/reinstalled R but no luck. Ideas?\n\n— Andrew Heiss (🐘 @andrew@fediscience.org) (@andrewheiss) February 7, 2021\n\n\nSo here is what ended up working. To start you will need a super simple Rmd file to test with in a local directory. I suggest starting a new Rmd file with nothing in it other than the default YAML header and “test” in the main body or “Lorem Ipsum” if you feel fancy.\nIn the terminal run the following code\n\ncd ~ \n\nls -la\n\nThen look for files starting with a period. Okay if you messed up in the initial blogdown setup you are looking for the “.Rprofile” that is causing you the problem. What ended up happening is that you broke all of R by including a recursive function. So restarting and uninstalling R will not kill the function it will be there\n\n\n\nWhat you are going to do is open a terminal in Rstudio or otherwise than start running this.\n\ncat.Rprofile\n\nthan run\n\ncat.zshrc\n\nthan after that run\nmv. Rprofile .Rprofile-original\nThen close out Rstudio and reopen Rstudio. Then try to knit your super simple Rmd file and install a package and doing something fun! Than knit that file.\nHopefully the dreaded C stack usage error is gone. If it is than celebrate\n\n\n\nbecause you can use R again!!!!"

    "text": "Introduction\nSince may I have had to start collecting data for my dissertation which is exciting and a little scary. I was also hired on to an NSF grant to do some data collection. Based on the data I needed for my dissertation and the data collection for the grant all this entailed a ton of web scraping. Which I had largely avoided before this and felt like out of my skill set.\nAfter like six months of having to do this more or less every week I decided to write this post to demystify the process a bit and for me to refer back to from time to time. For the most part webscraping is more like a solving a mystery rather than building a skyscrapper."

    "text": "I suppose at some point it is good to become more well versed in lots of tools. I have been python curious for about a year or so and I think it is important to use the tool best suited for the task. Also sometimes it is important to get out of your comfort zone. I am definitely somebody who is very comfortable in R and the tidyverse and use it for a lot of stuff. I have heard lots of ravings about polars specifically about its speed and similarities in intuition with the tidyverse. So I thought I would have a collection of code for myself and the people of the internet to reference.\nJust a disclaimer. This is really just me working through the similarities and is going to be based on the tidyintelligence’s blog post, Robert Mitchell’s blog post, and Emily Rieder’s blog post. In all honesty, this is just for me to smash them together to have a one-stop shop for myself. If you found this post over these resources I highly recommend you check out these resources."

I am definitely somebody who is very comfortable in R and the tidyverse and use it for a lot of stuff. I have heard lots of ravings about polars specifically about its speed and similarities in intuition with the tidyverse. So I thought I would have a collection of code for myself and the people of the internet to reference.\nJust a disclaimer. This is really just me working through the similarities and is going to be based on the tidyintelligence’s blog post, Robert Mitchell’s blog post, and Emily Rieder’s blog post. In all honesty, this is just for me to smash them together to have a one-stop shop for myself. If you found this post over these resources I highly recommend you check out these resources."

So lets define a simple dataset to work with.\n\nnational_data &lt;- tribble(\n  ~state, ~year, ~unemployment, ~inflation, ~population,\n  \"GA\",   2018,  5,             2,          100,\n  \"GA\",   2019,  5.3,           1.8,        200,\n  \"GA\",   2020,  5.2,           2.5,        300,\n  \"NC\",   2018,  6.1,           1.8,        350,\n  \"NC\",   2019,  5.9,           1.6,        375,\n  \"NC\",   2020,  5.3,           1.8,        400,\n  \"CO\",   2018,  4.7,           2.7,        200,\n  \"CO\",   2019,  4.4,           2.6,        300,\n  \"CO\",   2020,  5.1,           2.5,        400\n)\n\nnational_libraries &lt;- tribble(\n  ~state, ~year, ~libraries, ~schools,\n  \"CO\",   2018,  230,        470,\n  \"CO\",   2019,  240,        440,\n  \"CO\",   2020,  270,        510,\n  \"NC\",   2018,  200,        610,\n  \"NC\",   2019,  210,        590,\n  \"NC\",   2020,  220,        530,\n)\n\n\n\nnational_dict = {\"state\": [\"Ga\", \"Ga\", \"Ga\",  \"NC\", \"NC\", \"NC\", \"CO\", \"CO\", \"CO\"], \"unemployment\":[6,6,8,6,4,3,7,8,9], \"year\": [2019,2018,2017,2019,2018,2017,2019,2018,2017]}\n\n\nnational_data = pl.DataFrame(national_dict)\n\n\nlibrary_dict = {\"state\":[\"CO\", \"CO\", \"CO\"], \"libraries\": [23234,2343234,32342342], \"year\":[2019,2018,2017]}\n\n\nlibrary_data = pl.DataFrame(library_dict)\n\nWe may want to merge in the library dataset.

Instead of a nice join_by argument you have specify the keys separately.

    "text": "Plotting data\nConfession time. I hate matplots I never think they look very nice. However I as somebody who enjoys data visualization should learn how to do it in python too. From what I can tell there are a few different attempts at porting over ggplot. But It seems like working in something somewhat standard versus going polars and ibis all the way probably makes sense.\nOne thing that should be mentioned is that missing values in python are not the same. Since quarto was getting mad at me for some reason about not having installed the palmer penguins package I decided to stop fighting with it. One thing that is\n\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n\n\n\n\nsns.set_theme(style = \"whitegrid\")\n\nSo I think seaborne might be the way to go. Since I don’t think histograms will go out of style lets just go and make a histogram\n\n\nsns.histplot(data = penguins, x = \"body_mass_g\")\n\n\n\n\neasy enough\n\n\nsns.histplot(data = penguins, x = \"body_mass_g\", hue  = \"species\")\n\n\n\n\nWhat if we wanted densities instead of frequencies? In ggplot it would be\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, fill = species)) +\ngeom_histogram(aes(y =  after_stat(density)))\n\n\n\n\nIn sns it would be.\n\n\nsns.histplot(data = penguins, x = \"body_mass_g\", hue = \"species\", stat = \"density\")\n\n\n\n\nI really like the legend on the inside! In new ggplot 3.whatever it is\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, y = after_stat(density), fill = species)) +\ngeom_histogram() +\ntheme_minimal() +\ntheme(legend.position = c(.95,.95),\n      legend.justification = c(\"right\", \"top\"))\n\n\n\n\nCool I like that and will fiddle with that my ggplot theme!\nOkay lets now go and do some bivariate plots. Obviously the workhorse of bivariate plotting is the scatterplot .\n\n\nsns.scatterplot(data = penguins, x = \"flipper_length_mm\", y = \"body_mass_g\", hue = \"species\")\n\n\n\n\nthe next thing that we would want is to size points by the size of the penguin\n\n\nsns.scatterplot(data = penguins, x = \"flipper_length_mm\", y = \"body_mass_g\", hue = \"species\", size = \"body_mass_g\")\n\n\n\n\nThat is not really great since the legend is inside and covering stuff. In ggplot we would simply just move the legend position. In this case we have to save it as an object\n\n\nexmp = sns.scatterplot(data = penguins, x = \"flipper_length_mm\", y = \"body_mass_g\", hue = \"species\", size = \"body_mass_g\")\n\nsns.move_legend(exmp, \"upper left\", bbox_to_anchor = (1,1))\n\n\n\n\n\nsns.lmplot(data = penguins, x = \"flipper_length_mm\", y = \"body_mass_g\", hue = \"species\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen the other one that I use all the time is using a line of best fit . Okay obviously the most annoying part is that we don’t have great labels\n\nlabs_examp = sns.lmplot(data = penguins, x = \"flipper_length_mm\", y = \"body_mass_g\", hue = \"species\")\n\n\n\nlabs_examp.set_axis_labels(x_var= \"Flipper Length(mm)\", y_var = \"Body Mass(g)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the things we may want to do is to create small multiples.\n\nsns.displot(data = penguins, x = \"body_mass_g\", hue = \"species\", row= \"species\", facet_kws = dict(margin_titles=False))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am honestly not wild about the plot but that is life"

So no trusty dust glm or OLS when you open up python. From the excellent marginaleffects package it looks like there is a nice interface called statsmodels and they have a formula api which works like modeling in R just without lazy evaluation.\n\n\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\nimport numpy as np\n\nLets fit a few simple models to try and get the hang of statsmodels and see what happens.

This blog post will serve as my notes and hopefully as a resource for not myself. The general idea is I am just going to work through R4DS and the various dplyr verbs.

For the most part show_query outputs the right query but can be a little bit difficult to debug because of the limitations of showing things in the R console."

If we wanted to use aggregation functions we have to change how we do this\n\npengs |&gt;\n    filter(body_mass_g &lt; mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n    show_query()\n\n&lt;SQL&gt;\nSELECT\n  `species`,\n  `island`,\n  `bill_length_mm`,\n  `bill_depth_mm`,\n  `flipper_length_mm`,\n  `body_mass_g`,\n  `sex`,\n  `year`\nFROM (\n  SELECT `pengs`.*, AVG(`body_mass_g`) OVER () AS `col01`\n  FROM `pengs`\n) AS `q01`\nWHERE (`body_mass_g` &lt; `col01`)\n\n\nWhat is this OVER thing? OVER in SQL is a window function. There is a more technical way to explain this but heuristically when we pass AVG to WHERE we are effectively doing this. So there is not really anything to compare it too.\n\npengs |&gt;\n    summarise(mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# Source:   SQL [1 x 1]\n# Database: sqlite 3.46.0 [:memory:]\n  `mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)`\n                              &lt;dbl&gt;\n1                             4202.\n\n\nIf we wanted to filter penguins that are less than the average body mass we have to prevent this aggregation process by creating a column and then creating a less than statement like this\n\ntbl(con, sql(\"SELECT * FROM(\n              SELECT pengs .*, AVG(body_mass_g) OVER () AS avg\n               FROM pengs)\n              WHERE (body_mass_g &lt; avg)\"))\n\n# Source:   SQL [?? x 9]\n# Database: sqlite 3.46.0 [:memory:]\n   species island    bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g\n   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;int&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Adelie  Torgersen           39.1          18.7               181        3750\n 2 Adelie  Torgersen           39.5          17.4               186        3800\n 3 Adelie  Torgersen           40.3          18                 195        3250\n 4 Adelie  Torgersen           36.7          19.3               193        3450\n 5 Adelie  Torgersen           39.3          20.6               190        3650\n 6 Adelie  Torgersen           38.9          17.8               181        3625\n 7 Adelie  Torgersen           34.1          18.1               193        3475\n 8 Adelie  Torgersen           37.8          17.1               186        3300\n 9 Adelie  Torgersen           37.8          17.3               180        3700\n10 Adelie  Torgersen           41.1          17.6               182        3200\n# ℹ more rows\n# ℹ 3 more variables: sex &lt;chr&gt;, year &lt;int&gt;, avg &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nIt is a little clunky but the tl;dr is that we basically have two FROM statements so if we wanted all penguins between the minimum and the average we could do\n\nRSQL\n\n\n\npalmerpenguins::penguins |&gt;\n    filter(between(body_mass_g, left = min(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE), right = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)))\n\n# A tibble: 193 × 8\n   species island    bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g\n   &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;fct&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;int&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Adelie  Torgersen           39.1          18.7               181        3750\n 2 Adelie  Torgersen           39.5          17.4               186        3800\n 3 Adelie  Torgersen           40.3          18                 195        3250\n 4 Adelie  Torgersen           36.7          19.3               193        3450\n 5 Adelie  Torgersen           39.3          20.6               190        3650\n 6 Adelie  Torgersen           38.9          17.8               181        3625\n 7 Adelie  Torgersen           34.1          18.1               193        3475\n 8 Adelie  Torgersen           37.8          17.1               186        3300\n 9 Adelie  Torgersen           37.8          17.3               180        3700\n10 Adelie  Torgersen           41.1          17.6               182        3200\n# ℹ 183 more rows\n# ℹ 2 more variables: sex &lt;fct&gt;, year &lt;int&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\ntbl(con, sql(\"SELECT * FROM(\n             SELECT pengs .*, AVG(body_mass_g) OVER() AS avg, MIN(body_mass_g) OVER() AS min\n            FROM pengs)\n            WHERE body_mass_g BETWEEN min AND avg\"))\n\n# Source:   SQL [?? x 10]\n# Database: sqlite 3.46.0 [:memory:]\n   species island    bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g\n   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;int&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Adelie  Torgersen           39.1          18.7               181        3750\n 2 Adelie  Torgersen           39.5          17.4               186        3800\n 3 Adelie  Torgersen           40.3          18                 195        3250\n 4 Adelie  Torgersen           36.7          19.3               193        3450\n 5 Adelie  Torgersen           39.3          20.6               190        3650\n 6 Adelie  Torgersen           38.9          17.8               181        3625\n 7 Adelie  Torgersen           34.1          18.1               193        3475\n 8 Adelie  Torgersen           37.8          17.1               186        3300\n 9 Adelie  Torgersen           37.8          17.3               180        3700\n10 Adelie  Torgersen           41.1          17.6               182        3200\n# ℹ more rows\n# ℹ 4 more variables: sex &lt;chr&gt;, year &lt;int&gt;, avg &lt;dbl&gt;, min &lt;int&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you notice in all our examples, we have lots and lots of missing values.

We could do something like this but what we notice is that it is going to decide the join keys for us and probably create some headaches for us later on.

What changes is that instead of left_key = right_key we have to specify what is coming from what table using .\n\ndb_con = con4$con\n\nquery = \"SELECT *\n             FROM national_data\n             LEFT JOIN national_libraries\n             ON (\n             national_data.state = national_libraries.state AND\n             national_data.year = national_libraries.year\n             )\n             \"\n\ndbGetQuery(db_con, sql(query))       \n\n  state year unemployment inflation population state year libraries schools\n1    GA 2018          5.0       2.0        100  &lt;NA&gt;   NA        NA      NA\n2    GA 2019          5.3       1.8        200  &lt;NA&gt;   NA        NA      NA\n3    GA 2020          5.2       2.5        300  &lt;NA&gt;   NA        NA      NA\n4    NC 2018          6.1       1.8        350    NC 2018       200     610\n5    NC 2019          5.9       1.6        375    NC 2019       210     590\n6    NC 2020          5.3       1.8        400    NC 2020       220     530\n7    CO 2018          4.7       2.7        200    CO 2018       230     470\n8    CO 2019          4.4       2.6        300    CO 2019       240     440\n9    CO 2020          5.1       2.5        400    CO 2020       270     510\n\n\n\n\nFor whatever reason with SQLite gets a little grumpy with the join syntax.\nIf we wanted to do various other joins like inner and anti joins we would do a similar thing.\n\nquery = \"SELECT * \n        FROM national_data\n    INNER JOIN national_libraries \n    ON(\n    national_data.state = national_libraries.state AND\n    national_data.year = national_libraries.year\n    )\n\"\n\ndbGetQuery(db_con, sql(query))\n\n  state year unemployment inflation population state year libraries schools\n1    CO 2018          4.7       2.7        200    CO 2018       230     470\n2    CO 2019          4.4       2.6        300    CO 2019       240     440\n3    CO 2020          5.1       2.5        400    CO 2020       270     510\n4    NC 2018          6.1       1.8        350    NC 2018       200     610\n5    NC 2019          5.9       1.6        375    NC 2019       210     590\n6    NC 2020          5.3       1.8        400    NC 2020       220     530\n\n\n\n\nInequality joins\nConfession I have never really understood how inequality joins work in regular dplyr but I am sure at some point I am going to need them and now when the stakes are so low is a good time to do it. So lets just take the data from the dplyr 1.1.0 announcement to do this since we know what the output should be.\n\ncompanies &lt;- tibble(\n  id = c(\"A\", \"B\", \"B\"),\n  since = c(1973, 2009, 2022),\n  name = c(\"Patagonia\", \"RStudio\", \"Posit\")\n)\n\ntransactions &lt;- tibble(\n  company = c(\"A\", \"A\", \"B\", \"B\"),\n  year = c(2019, 2020, 2021, 2023),\n  revenue = c(50, 4, 10, 12)\n)\n\ncompanies = copy_to(con3, companies, overwrite = TRUE)\n\ntransactions = copy_to(con4, transactions, overwrite = TRUE)\n\ndb_con = con3$con\n\nSo the main idea of an inequality join is that we can join by a key in this case company but only keep records from a certain date. The blog post kind of equates it with a filter/WHERE that happens during the join phase. So we would see something like this\n\ntransactions |&gt;\n  inner_join(companies, join_by(company == id, year &gt;= since)) \n\n# Source:   SQL [5 x 5]\n# Database: sqlite 3.46.0 [:memory:]\n  company  year revenue since name     \n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    \n1 A        2019      50  1973 Patagonia\n2 A        2020       4  1973 Patagonia\n3 B        2021      10  2009 RStudio  \n4 B        2023      12  2009 RStudio  \n5 B        2023      12  2022 Posit    \n\n\nInstead of two equality statements we would effectively use the same syntax just swapping out the = with &gt;=\n\nquery = \"\n      SELECT * FROM transactions\n      INNER JOIN companies \n      ON(\n      transactions.company = companies.id AND\n      transactions.year &gt;= companies.since\n      )\n\n\"\n\ndbGetQuery(db_con, sql(query))\n\n  company year revenue id since      name\n1       A 2019      50  A  1973 Patagonia\n2       A 2020       4  A  1973 Patagonia\n3       B 2021      10  B  2009   RStudio\n4       B 2023      12  B  2009   RStudio\n5       B 2023      12  B  2022     Posit"

    "text": "Pivots\nIn tidyverse parlance we use pivots to change the “shape of the data.” If you are unfamiliar with this idea consider the religion and income data below. You will notice that we have a column for each income bracket or what is sometimes called “wide” data. This may be useful for some question but generally if we want to plot things or do things it will be easier if they are “long” data.\n\n\nCode\ncon5 = src_memdb()\n\nrelig = copy_to(con5, relig_income, overwrite = TRUE)\n\nhead(relig_income, n = 2)\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 11\n  religion `&lt;$10k` `$10-20k` `$20-30k` `$30-40k` `$40-50k` `$50-75k` `$75-100k`\n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Agnostic      27        34        60        81        76       137        122\n2 Atheist       12        27        37        52        35        70         73\n# ℹ 3 more variables: `$100-150k` &lt;dbl&gt;, `&gt;150k` &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   `Don't know/refused` &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nTo make our data “long” we use pivot_longer and to make data “wide” we use pivot_wider each has their own quirks but the general idea is that we have to tell these functions where to put the old names/where to get the new names and where to put the old values/where to get the new values. So if we wanted to make our data longer we would do something like this.\n\nlong = relig_income |&gt;\n    pivot_longer(-religion,\n                names_to = 'income_bracket',\n                values_to = 'income')\n\nhead(long, n = 2)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  religion income_bracket income\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Agnostic &lt;$10k              27\n2 Agnostic $10-20k            34\n\n\nIf we wanted to make this wide again all we would do is reverse this with pivot_wider\n\nwide = long |&gt;\n    pivot_wider(names_from = income_bracket, values_from = income)\n\n\n\nThere are ton of additional functionality that will not be covered like dealing with not uniquely identified columns.\nTo get a sense of how to do this let’s consult our old friend show_query\n\nrelig |&gt;\n    pivot_longer(-religion,\n                names_to = 'income_bracket',\n                values_to = 'income') |&gt;\n                    show_query()\n\nWe are not going to actually show the results because it is quite the query. The summary of what is happening is that SQLite doesn’t have a perfect equivalent of pivot_longer. Basically, what you need to do is to keep appending smaller and smaller data frames to each other until you get to a long data frame. In other flavors of SQL this process is a lot more humane with explicit PIVOT and UNPIVOT but I am not in one of those flavors. To spare myself a bit I am just going to do two columns\n\ntbl(con5, sql(\"\n    SELECT religion, '&lt;$10k' AS income_bracket, '&lt;$10k' AS income\n    FROM relig_income \n\n    UNION ALL\n\n    SELECT religion, '$10-20k' AS income_bracket, '$10-20k' AS income\n    FROM relig_income\n\n    UNION ALL\n\n    SELECT religion, '$20-30k' AS income_bracket, '$20-30k' AS income\n    FROM relig_income\n\n    \n\"))\n\n# Source:   SQL [?? x 3]\n# Database: sqlite 3.46.0 [:memory:]\n   religion                income_bracket income\n   &lt;chr&gt;                   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt; \n 1 Agnostic                &lt;$10k          &lt;$10k \n 2 Atheist                 &lt;$10k          &lt;$10k \n 3 Buddhist                &lt;$10k          &lt;$10k \n 4 Catholic                &lt;$10k          &lt;$10k \n 5 Don’t know/refused      &lt;$10k          &lt;$10k \n 6 Evangelical Prot        &lt;$10k          &lt;$10k \n 7 Hindu                   &lt;$10k          &lt;$10k \n 8 Historically Black Prot &lt;$10k          &lt;$10k \n 9 Jehovah's Witness       &lt;$10k          &lt;$10k \n10 Jewish                  &lt;$10k          &lt;$10k \n# ℹ more rows\n\n\nI am a little scared to see what this looks for pivot_wider but we should at least give it a go.\n\nlong = relig |&gt;\n    pivot_longer(-religion,\n                 names_to = 'income_bracket',\n                 values_to = 'income')\n\nlong |&gt;\n    pivot_wider(names_from = income_bracket, values_from = income) |&gt;\n    show_query()\n\nOkay again this is a little unwieldy to show. Basically what happens is that we are creating a big case_when condition and then from there we are going to use the same binding trick and then group the data. So lets go ahead and copy and paste some of this.\n\n\nCode\nquery = \"\nSELECT\n    religion,\n    MAX(CASE WHEN (income_bracket = '&lt;$10k') THEN income END) AS '&lt;$10K',\n    MAX(CASE WHEN (income_bracket = '$10-20k') THEN income END) AS '$10-20k',\n    MAX(CASE WHEN (income_bracket = '$20-30k') THEN income END) AS '$20-30k'\nFROM (\n    SELECT religion, '&lt;$10k' AS income_bracket, '&lt;$10k' AS income\n    FROM relig_income\n\n    UNION ALL\n\n    SELECT religion, '$10-20k' AS income_bracket, '$10-20k' AS income\n    FROM relig_income\n\n    UNION ALL\n\n    SELECT religion, '$20-30k' AS income_bracket, '$20-30k' AS income\n    FROM relig_income\n) AS wide_religion\nGROUP BY religion\n\"\n\ntbl(con5, sql(query))\n\n\n# Source:   SQL [?? x 4]\n# Database: sqlite 3.46.0 [:memory:]\n   religion                `&lt;$10K` `$10-20k` `$20-30k`\n   &lt;chr&gt;                   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;    \n 1 Agnostic                &lt;$10k   $10-20k   $20-30k  \n 2 Atheist                 &lt;$10k   $10-20k   $20-30k  \n 3 Buddhist                &lt;$10k   $10-20k   $20-30k  \n 4 Catholic                &lt;$10k   $10-20k   $20-30k  \n 5 Don’t know/refused      &lt;$10k   $10-20k   $20-30k  \n 6 Evangelical Prot        &lt;$10k   $10-20k   $20-30k  \n 7 Hindu                   &lt;$10k   $10-20k   $20-30k  \n 8 Historically Black Prot &lt;$10k   $10-20k   $20-30k  \n 9 Jehovah's Witness       &lt;$10k   $10-20k   $20-30k  \n10 Jewish                  &lt;$10k   $10-20k   $20-30k  \n# ℹ more rows"

So in dense_rank and min_rank both id 2 and 3 get assigned the same rank where they differ is dense_rank will assign id 4 the rank of 3 and min_rank will assign id 4 the rank of 4.\nSo how would we do this in SQL\n\ncon7 = src_memdb()\n\nteam_rankings = copy_to(con7, example)\n\nteam_rankings |&gt;\n    mutate(rank_one = dense_rank(col1)) |&gt;\n    show_query()\n\n&lt;SQL&gt;\nSELECT\n  `example`.*,\n  CASE\nWHEN (NOT((`col1` IS NULL))) THEN DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY (CASE WHEN ((`col1` IS NULL)) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) ORDER BY `col1`)\nEND AS `rank_one`\nFROM `example`\n\n\nThis is deceptively a bit more complex.

    "text": "Ranking\nThere are lots of different ways to rank things in R if we want to return the min/max you can do\n\npengs |&gt;\n    slice_max(bill_length_mm, n = 3)\n\n# Source:   SQL [3 x 8]\n# Database: sqlite 3.46.0 [:memory:]\n  species   island bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;int&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n1 Gentoo    Biscoe           59.6          17                 230        6050\n2 Chinstrap Dream            58            17.8               181        3700\n3 Gentoo    Biscoe           55.9          17                 228        5600\n# ℹ 2 more variables: sex &lt;chr&gt;, year &lt;int&gt;\n\n\nThere are also various ranking functions.\n\nexample = tribble(~id, ~col1,\n                   1, 1,\n                   2, 2,\n                   3, 2,\n                   4, 3,\n                   5, 4)\n\nexample |&gt;\n    mutate(rank_one = dense_rank(col1),\n           rank_two = min_rank(col1))\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 4\n     id  col1 rank_one rank_two\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n1     1     1        1        1\n2     2     2        2        2\n3     3     2        2        2\n4     4     3        3        4\n5     5     4        4        5\n\n\nLike our dplyr join functions the dense_rank and min_rank function actually takes inspiration from SQL. So in our example where the two functions differ is how they handle ties. So in dense_rank and min_rank both id 2 and 3 get assigned the same rank where they differ is dense_rank will assign id 4 the rank of 3 and min_rank will assign id 4 the rank of 4.\nSo how would we do this in SQL\n\ncon7 = src_memdb()\n\nteam_rankings = copy_to(con7, example)\n\nteam_rankings |&gt;\n    mutate(rank_one = dense_rank(col1)) |&gt;\n    show_query()\n\n&lt;SQL&gt;\nSELECT\n  `example`.*,\n  CASE\nWHEN (NOT((`col1` IS NULL))) THEN DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY (CASE WHEN ((`col1` IS NULL)) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) ORDER BY `col1`)\nEND AS `rank_one`\nFROM `example`\n\n\nThis is deceptively a bit more complex. So lets break it down.\n\ntbl(con7, sql(\"\nSELECT\nexample .*,\n    CASE \nWHEN (NOT((col1 is NULL))) THEN DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY (CASE WHEN ((col1 is NULL)) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) ORDER BY col1)\nEND AS rank_one\nFROM example\n\"))\n\n# Source:   SQL [5 x 3]\n# Database: sqlite 3.46.0 [:memory:]\n     id  col1 rank_one\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n1     1     1        1\n2     2     2        2\n3     3     2        2\n4     4     3        3\n5     5     4        4\n\n\nSo basically the PARTITION BY bit is used to divide the data into groups before we rank them. The CASE WHEN handles when we have missing values. Then the window function is applying dense rank over these partions. This was a somewhat silly example so lets do something a bit more realistic. Lets say we actually want to rank the penguins by average bill length and then return the penguins in the top 3.\n\ntbl(con, sql(\n    \"\n    SELECT\n    ranked_pengs .*,\n    CASE\n    WHEN (NOT((avg_bill_length is NULL))) THEN DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY (CASE WHEN ((avg_bill_length is NULL)) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) ORDER BY avg_bill_length)\n    END AS rank\n    FROM( \n     SELECT pengs .*, AVG(bill_length_mm) OVER () AS avg_bill_length\n     FROM pengs)\n     AS ranked_pengs \n     LIMIT 3\n    \"\n))\n\n# Source:   SQL [3 x 10]\n# Database: sqlite 3.46.0 [:memory:]\n  species island    bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g\n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;int&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n1 Adelie  Torgersen           39.1          18.7               181        3750\n2 Adelie  Torgersen           39.5          17.4               186        3800\n3 Adelie  Torgersen           40.3          18                 195        3250\n# ℹ 4 more variables: sex &lt;chr&gt;, year &lt;int&gt;, avg_bill_length &lt;dbl&gt;, rank &lt;int&gt;\n\n\nWe could also do this by groups by just inserting a group by statement before the limit bit\n\ntbl(con, sql(\n    \"\n    SELECT\n    ranked_pengs .*,\n    CASE\n    WHEN (NOT((avg_bill_length is NULL))) THEN DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY (CASE WHEN ((avg_bill_length is NULL)) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) ORDER BY avg_bill_length)\n    END AS rank\n    FROM( \n     SELECT pengs .*, AVG(bill_length_mm) OVER () AS avg_bill_length\n     FROM pengs)\n     AS ranked_pengs \n     GROUP BY species\n     LIMIT 3\n    \"\n))\n\n# Source:   SQL [3 x 10]\n# Database: sqlite 3.46.0 [:memory:]\n  species   island    bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;int&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n1 Adelie    Torgersen           39.1          18.7               181        3750\n2 Chinstrap Dream               46.5          17.9               192        3500\n3 Gentoo    Biscoe              46.1          13.2               211        4500\n# ℹ 4 more variables: sex &lt;chr&gt;, year &lt;int&gt;, avg_bill_length &lt;dbl&gt;, rank &lt;int&gt;"
